## üöÄ Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, selecting the perfect hotel can be overwhelming with numerous options available online. This project simplifies the process by analyzing customer feedback‚Äîincluding textual reviews and ratings‚Äîto recommend hotels tailored to various travel needs such as business trips, honeymoons, and leisure stays. The system leverages machine learning techniques to rank hotels according to their relevance and quality.

## üéØ Aim

The goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system that predicts which hotel a user is most likely to choose based on:
- **Location:** The country in which the hotel is located.
- **Description:** The user‚Äôs detailed preferences and requirements.

By analyzing hotel reviews and associated tags, the system provides recommendations that match the user's desired travel experience while considering the hotel's average rating and overall user feedback.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Convert user description and hotel tags to lower case.
   - Remove stopwords and perform lemmatization.
   - Tokenize text using NLTK for analysis.

2. **Filtering:**  
   - Filter the dataset by the selected location.
   - Calculate similarity scores between the user‚Äôs description and hotel tags.

3. **Ranking:**  
   - Rank hotels based on similarity scores and average ratings.
   - Present the top recommendations to the user.
